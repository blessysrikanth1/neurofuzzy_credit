## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Hybrid AI Approach**: Combines Neural Networks & Fuzzy Logic  
- ✅ **Handles Uncertainty & Ambiguity** in credit assessment  
- ✅ **Improved Accuracy** over traditional models  
- ✅ **Adaptable to Changing Financial Conditions**  
- ✅ **Transparent & Interpretable Decision-Making Process**

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handles missing values  
   - Feature scaling & encoding  
2️⃣ **Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)**  
   - Defines credit scoring rules  
   - Assigns fuzzy values to input variables  
3️⃣ **Neural Network Training**  
   - Learns patterns in customer credit behavior  
4️⃣ **Hybrid Decision Making**  
   - Combines both models for final credit score prediction

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of customer financial data, including:
- 🔹 **Age**  
- 🔹 **Income Level**  
- 🔹 **Loan Repayment History**  
- 🔹 **Debt-to-Income Ratio**  
- 🔹 **Previous Credit Score**  
- 🔹 **Employment Status**
