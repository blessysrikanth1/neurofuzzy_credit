# 🧠 Neuro-Fuzzy Credit Scoring System

## 📌 Overview
The **Neuro-Fuzzy Credit Scoring System** is an AI-driven model that integrates **Neural Networks** and **Fuzzy Logic** to assess creditworthiness. This approach provides a more flexible and adaptive method for evaluating credit risk compared to traditional scoring models.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Combines Neural Networks & Fuzzy Logic** for robust decision-making  
- ✅ **Handles Uncertainty & Ambiguity** in credit scoring  
- ✅ **Improves Accuracy** over traditional statistical models  
- ✅ **Adaptable to Changing Financial Conditions**  
- ✅ **Interpretable Decision-Making Process**

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
The system consists of:
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature scaling & encoding  
2. **Fuzzy Inference System (FIS)**  
   - Defines credit scoring rules  
   - Assigns fuzzy values to input variables  
3. **Neural Network Training**  
   - Trained on historical financial data  
   - Learns patterns in customer credit behavior  
4. **Hybrid Decision Making**  
   - Outputs a final credit score based on both models

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains **customer financial information**, including:
- 🔹 **Age**  
- 🔹 **Income Level**  
- 🔹 **Loan Repayment History**  
- 🔹 **Debt-to-Income Ratio**  
- 🔹 **Previous Credit Score**  
- 🔹 **Employment Status**
